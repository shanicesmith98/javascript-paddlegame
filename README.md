# Paddle Game

Created a JavaScript Paddle game for users to play against computer (NPC) on their web browser. First player to the chosen winning score wins!
Users are prompted to choose the background color, ball color, and winning score before gameplay. Default color of background and ball is black and white.

Made with the guidance of Chris DeLeon's [Code Your First Game Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/code-your-first-game/).
